% The BibTex of a reference can be copied from e.g. Google Scholar, it is good practice to include DOI as well when available. 

% Remember commas between every field! Comments inside citation fields does not work, but outside like this does.

% Beaware that references will be doubled if you accidentally make the same using different citation keys! Therefore, I highly recommend you use a convention such as Google's {main author's family name}{year}{first word/whatever you want to make it easier for yourself}. Or at least doublecheck the references for double entries before submitting.
