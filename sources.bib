% The BibTex of a reference can be copied from e.g. Google Scholar, it is good practice to include DOI or URI as well when available. 

% Remember commas between every field! Comments inside citation fields does not work, but outside like this does.

% Beaware of double entries, that is, references will be doubled if you accidentally create two or more BibLatex entries for the same reference with different citation keys! I highly recommend you use a convention such as Google's {main author's family name}{year}{first word or better, keyword}. Or at least doublecheck the references for double entries before submitting.
