\enquote{Literature reviews present and critically analyse relevant works and the relationships between
them and place the thesis within a larger context by demonstrating how work undertaken in the
thesis seeks to fill a gap in, or extend, current knowledge.

Personal opinions and points of view should not be included in this chapter.

Correct and unambiguous references must accompany all information derived from academic
literature and other relevant sources.} (\cite{handbook})
