\enquote{This chapter presents the data or results of the research or product development. It consists of
a logical presentation of the data. The results should be organised, classified, analysed and (if relevant) categorised. Where appropriate, diagrams and tables should be used to provide an overview of the results.

The results should be explained and interpreted (e.g., differences between various studies), and
their reliability and validity should be assessed and evaluated.

Results or product developments must be presented in a clear, objective and unbiased manner.} \citep{handbook}
