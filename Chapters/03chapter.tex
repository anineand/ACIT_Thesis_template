\chapter{Methodology}
\label{ch:03methodology}

\enquote{The methodology chapter should describe how data was collected or the product was produced
in a comprehensive, systematic and sufficiently detailed manner. It is important to justify the process by which the research questions, which were derived through an analysis of the relevant literature, were answered. All the methods chosen must be fully justified, and reasons for rejecting other feasible methods explained.

The documentation of which methods were used and how they were implemented should allow
other researchers to reproduce them in other studies or verify the results.

For product development projects, the choice of design and developing process(es) must be
justified and described.} \citep{handbook}

Note that the literature review and methodology can be placed where ever you want after \cref{ch:intro}, as long as it is before results.
