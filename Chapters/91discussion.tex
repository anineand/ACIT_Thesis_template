\label{ch:discussion}

`This chapter introduces analytical and critical thinking in relation to the results or developed
product and analysis, with reference to the theoretical arguments described in the literature
review. Ensure that you allocate sufficient time to analyse, assess and relate your findings or
product to the literature.
Consider the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In which ways do your results or developed product agree with previous research and
    literature and what are the major differences?
    \item What is the utility value of your results or product?
    \item Which interpretations of your results can you suggest?
    \item What are the strong and weak aspects of your research?
    \item Are the results significant?
    \item Is it possible to generalise your findings?
    \item Are there any potential criticisms of your research?Â´
\end{itemize} \citep{handbook}
